# Online-Pizza-Ordering-System
A website where customers can order their favourite pizza
with a selection of toppings and sides, for delivery or collection. The user can create an account
and see all the previous orders in detail. This project has been written in JavaScript using NodeJS. I
have used an SQLITE database and an MVC architecture. For the front-end I have used EJS
templates.
